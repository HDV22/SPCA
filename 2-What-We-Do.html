    <p>  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or SPCA for short, is committed to <em>safeguarding all animals</em> from abuse, neglect, 
        and ill treatment, which frequently arises from a lack of understanding of animals and their needs.<br><br><strong> we say "all" animals, we really mean 
        "all" animals, including agricultural animals, poultry, and even wild animals like dogs, cats, and rabbits.</strong><br><br>We were members of the World Society 
        for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) until it was abolished, and we currently serve on the board of the National Council of SPCAs South Africa (NSPCA).<br><br>
        As a group, WE works to preserve the following values: Passion for the Welfare of Animals Care for the Welfare of Animals Excellence in Everything We Do 
        Integrity in Everything We Do</p><br><br>
    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <dl>
    <h4><dt>Cruelty prevention</dt></h4>
    <dd>To improve animal welfare, SPCA engages, educates and builds relationships with communities and agencies. 
        We want everyone to know how to love and respect their animals.</dd>
     <br> 
    <h4><dt>Educate & Engage</dt></h4>
    <dd>The SPCA cares for thousands of abused, neglected and injured animals each year. The SPCA's goal is to end abuse and make a real difference. 
        To change the hearts and minds of the next generation,we have developed free educational programmes for schools and people who work with children.</dd>
    <br> 
    <h4><dt>Animal rescue</dt></h4>
    <dd>Every day, our SPCA inspectors, field officers, and rescue teams are out in the field.
        They save animals that have been injured in accidents, mistreated, abandoned, neglected, or affected by a natural calamity.</dd>
    <br>
    <h4><dt>Rehabilitate</dt></h4>
    <dd>All animals entering SPCA care must first go through one of our SPCA Centers, animal hospitals, or partner veterinary practices.
        Here, we offer vital assistance and medical attention to ill and hurt animals, as well as regular health examinations, immunizations, 
        and microchipping.</dd>
    <br>    
    <h4><dt>Shelter, Rehome & Reunite</dt></h4>
    <dd>We offer a sanctuary for ill, hurt, abused, and abandoned animals. Until we find them their forever home, we provide them with love,
        care, and a roof over their heads.</dd> 
    <br>   
    <h4><dt>Seek justice.</dt></h4>
    <dd>One of the few organizations with the legal authority to aid disadvantaged animals and prosecute animal abusers is the SPCA.</dd>
